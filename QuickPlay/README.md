- This took me ages so if you could subscribe (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCasgtGl0LX5gTgvVAFpvr5g) That would be great! I upload alot of MCP and other usefull things!

- Crediting would be nice but you dont have to!

- Instrucions:
- Put the QuickPlay folder with images in your client assets folder
- Open the TransparentButton Folder and put the class in your client/src/net/minecraft/client/gui/
- Make a Keybind in GameSettings.java called CLIENT_QUICKPLAY
- Put all of the remaining classes into your mod packages
- Click your set keybind in game and it should come up!
